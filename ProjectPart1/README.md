# Coupon System - Part I

This is the first part of my final project of Java course @ John Bryce School

This project requires the JDBC MYSQL to connect to the database. The credentials for the connection profile are

**url**: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/Coupon_db?useSSL=false

**user**: root

**password**: 1234

These credentials can also be found in /src/utils/ConnectionPool.java.

The manipulating commands for the tables of the project's database can be found in /manipulation-script
